E-MOODY

Even when emotions are challenging to manage, acknowledging them is essential to maintaining the mental health of an individual. Suppressing emotions can lead to anxiety and depression. It can also cause some mental illnesses that can hurt an individual. Healthily expressing emotions can reduce the chance of getting stressed or anxious. With this reasoning, coming up with this topic can help the user monitor and improve their mood on a daily basis. The Mood Improvement App is an application that tracks the mood of an individual. Any individual's moods and emotions have an impact on their productivity, so it's crucial that the employee accepts responsibility for them in order to improve workplace productivity. Therefore, the developers will make sure that the software performance will be constantly monitored in order to prevent software malfunction and the appearance of bugs and glitches.
